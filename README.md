## üìä What is Data Rescue?  

**Data Rescue** is a professional-grade data recovery application for macOS built to retrieve lost, deleted, or inaccessible files from a wide range of storage devices.  
It combines intuitive workflows with powerful scanning engines ‚Äî offering both quick scans for recently deleted items and deep scans that reconstruct files from damaged or formatted volumes.  
The software supports recovery from internal drives, external HDDs/SSDs, USB flash drives, SD cards, and other removable media.

Beyond simple file recovery, Data Rescue includes features that help maximize the chance of successful restoration: preview recoverable files before restoring them, filter results by file type (documents, images, video, audio), and direct recovered data to a separate target drive to prevent overwriting.  
It also supports modern Apple storage formats (APFS, HFS+) as well as common cross-platform formats (exFAT, FAT), and is updated to work with Apple Silicon Macs and recent macOS releases.

For professionals and creative users, Data Rescue adds value with advanced options such as cloning a failing drive to an image for safer recovery, saving session states to resume later, and running integrity checks on recovered files.  
Its combination of automated wizards for beginners and granular tools for experts makes it suitable for IT technicians, photographers, videographers, and anyone who needs dependable data retrieval from damaged or corrupted storage.

With Data Rescue you can:
- Perform **quick scans** for recently deleted files and **deep scans** for formatted or severely damaged volumes.  
- Preview recoverable items and **filter by file type** for faster results.  
- Clone failing drives to disk images and recover from the image to avoid further degradation.  
- Recover from **internal and external drives, SSDs, memory cards, and USB devices**.  
- Save recovered files to a separate destination to avoid data overwrite.  
- Use modern file system support and Apple Silicon compatibility for current macOS environments.
